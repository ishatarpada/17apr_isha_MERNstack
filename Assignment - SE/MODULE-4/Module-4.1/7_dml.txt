7.What is DML Compiler in SQL?

=> DML (Data Manipulation Language) compiler is a component or module within a database management system (DBMS) that handles the execution of DML statements. 
=> DML statements are used to retrieve, modify, insert, and delete data within a database.
=> The DML compiler processes and translates DML statements written in SQL into executable instructions that the DBMS can understand and perform. 
=> It takes care of the low-level details of data access and manipulation, allowing users to interact with the database using high-level SQL statements.
