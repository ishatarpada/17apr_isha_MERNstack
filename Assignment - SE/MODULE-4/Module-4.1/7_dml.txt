7.What is DML Compiler in SQL?

=> DML (Data Manipulation Language) compiler is a component or module within a database management system (DBMS) that handles the execution of DML statements. 
=> DML statements are used to retrieve, modify, insert, and delete data within a database.
=> The DML compiler processes and translates DML statements written in SQL into executable instructions that the DBMS can understand and perform. 
=> It takes care of the low-level details of data access and manipulation, allowing users to interact with the database using high-level SQL statements.

=> DML statements:-

INSERT query: insert the data in table
		syntex:-
                INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
                VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...),
                    (value1, value2, value3, ...),
                    (value1, value2, value3, ...),
                    (value1, value2, value3, ...);
        example:-
                INSERT INTO student (sid , sname , sphone ,  smail)
                VALUES ( '1' , 'isha' , '6354324255' , 'isha@gmail.com'),
                ( '2' , 'disha' , '6351299108' , 'disha@gmail.com'),
                ( '3' , 'manshi' , '7359380902' , 'manshi@gmail.com');

UPDATE query:- modify the existing records in a table.
		syntex:
				UPDATE table_name
				SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
				WHERE condition;
         example:-                   
	            UPDATE student SET sname = 'Isha'  WHERE sid = 1; 	

DELETE query: It is used to delete records from a database table.
        synetx:-
                DELETE FROM `table_name`; 
        example:-
                DELETE FROM `student`; 
        Delete specific record 
        synetx:-
            DELETE FROM `table_name` WHERE condition
        example:-
            DELETE FROM `student` WHERE sid = 101
        Delete column
        synetx:-
            DELETE column `column_name` where = condition;
        example:-
            DELETE column `sid` where sid = 101;
