        <p>
            &#8658;The float property is used for positioning and formatting content e.g. let an image float left to the
            text in a container.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <p>&#9755; Float Property have following values</p>
            <li>Float : left
                <br>
                &numsp;&numsp;&#8658;The element floats to the left of its container
            </li>
            <li>Float : right
                <br>
                &numsp;&numsp;&#8658;The element floats to the right of its container
            </li>

                <br>
                &numsp;&numsp;&#8658;The element does not float (will be displayed just where it occurs in the text).
                This is default

                    The lotus plant is an aquatic plant that is native to regions throughout East Asia and the South
                    Pacific. The plant grows in slow-flowing water including ponds, floodplains, and river deltas in
                    countries including India, China, and Russia.The plants sink their roots in water-covered soil and then
                    send up stems that give way to large circular leaves that float on top of the water's surface. Although
                    these leaves look like lily pads, lotus plants are different from true water lilies.The plants also send
                    forth flower stalks that rise above the water's surface. One round flower bud appears atop each stalk
                    and eventually blooms into a stunning flower with many petals.

                    Tulip cultivation likely began in Persia (Iran) in the 10th century, and it eventually became a symbol of the Ottoman Empire. Tulips were introduced to the Western world by Augier Ghislain de Busbecq, the Viennese ambassador to Turkey, who wrote of seeing the plants in Edirne, Turkey, in 1551 and later sent some seeds to Austria. The arrival at Antwerp in 1562 of a cargo of tulip bulbs from Constantinople (now Istanbul) marked the beginning of the horticultural tulip industry in Europe. An early recipient of these flowers was French botanist Carolus Clusius, who was an avid bulb grower and is often credited with the spread of other spring bulbs, such as hyacinths and irises, across Europe.
