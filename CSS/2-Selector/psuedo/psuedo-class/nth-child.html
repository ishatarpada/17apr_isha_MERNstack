        <h1>Psuedo Class - nth-child</h1>
        <p>
            &#x21e5; The :nth-child(n) selector matches every element that is the nth child of its parent.
            <br>
            &#x21e5; n can be a number, a keyword (odd or even), or a formula (like an + b).
            <br>
            &#x21e5; Tip: Look at the :nth-of-type() selector to select the element that is the nth child, of the same
            type (tag name), of its parent.
