Components are the building blocks of a React application.
They contain logic and UI elements.

Types of Components:
Functional Components:
Class Components:


Functional Components:- Simple components defined as functions.
hooks make functional components capable of handling complex logic similarly to class components.

<script>
  const MyComponent = () => {
    return <div>Hello World</div>;
  };
</script>

Class Components: More complex components defined as ES6 classes.
Used for more complex logic involving state and lifecycle methods.

Class Components :-
<script>
  class MyComponent extends React.Component {
    render() {
      return <div>Hello World</div>;
    }
  }
</script>
