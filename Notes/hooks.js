React Hooks => predefined function and  we use state and other React features in functional components.

1. useState() => store the data locally
2. useRef() =>helps you keep track of something without causing your component to re - render.
3. useEffect() => side effect is anything that affects something outside the scope of the function being executed, like fetching data from an API, updating the DOM, or setting up a timer

cleanUp => it is used for the stop the side effect of useEffect function.
