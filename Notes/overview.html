React Js :- 
  React is framework of javascript and it is created by facebook.
  React Js is tool for building UI components.
  React Js is single page application.
  React is allows to reuse the components.

React JS Work :-
  reacts create the virtual dom in memory.
  browser takes HTML and create DOM .
  javascript helps modify DOM based on user action or events.
   React creates a virtual DOM in memory, where it does all the necessary changes , manipulating before making the changes in the browser DOM.

React Version :- 
  V18.0.0

setting React App:-
  1. create a React application => npm create vite@latest
  2. navigate the first_app folder => cd first_app
  3. start the server => npm run dev

ES6 :- 
  ES6 stands for ECMAScript 6.
  created for standardize javascript.
    Classes
    Arrow Functions
    Variables (let, const, var)
    Array Methods like .map()
    Destructuring
    Modules
    Ternary Operator
    Spread Operator

Classes :- 
  Classes is blue print of the object .
  Classes is the template for the method and properties

    class Car {
      constructor(name) {
        this.brand = name;
      }
      
      present() {
        return 'I have a ' + this.brand;
      }
    }

    const mycar = new Car("Ford");
    mycar.present();

Arrow Function :- 
  Arrow functions allow us to write shorter function.

  show = () =>{
    return "Hello World!";
  }

Variables  :- variables is created using let ,  var , const.

var :- can reassign or redeclare the value.
let :-  reassign the value but not redeclare the value.
const :- can not reassign or redeclare the value;


Array :- 
  map() method :- .map() method allows you to run a function on each item in the array, returning a new array as the result.

const array = ['apple' , 'banana' , 'orange'];
const list = array.map((item) => <p>{list}</p>);

JSX :- javascript XML.
  allows us to write HTML in react.
  easier to write and add HTML in React.

components :- Components are like functions that return HTML elements.
Components are independent and reusable bits of code.
Components is  two types,
   Class components 
   Function components

LifeCycle Of Components :-  
  1. Mounting => putting elements into the DOM.
  2. Updating => component is updated.
  3. Unmounting => component is removed from the DOM.

Hooks :- allow function component to have access state and other react feature.

what is hooks ?
 hooks is a one type of functions i.e hook a services inside of react js.
 hooks is no more supported inside of class components.
 hooks is used to destructures of data in form of array or objects.
    const[data,setData]=useState([]);
    
     data => data is a variables
     setData => setData is a function  



  types of hooks ?
   a) useState() :useState is used to stored data , manage state data, destructured data 
        const[data,setData]=useState([]);

   b) useEffects(): useEffects is used to add effects, fetch data , manage data or add dependency add

            1) [] =>render only one times 
                useEffect(() => {
                  //Runs on every render
                });

            2) no dependency =>render again and again  
                useEffect(() => {
                  //Runs only on the first render
                }, []);

            3) [props,state] =>render only one times but we change or update data any times.
                  useEffect(() => {
                    //Runs on the first render
                    //And any time any dependency value changes
                  }, [prop, state]);
             
   c) useRef() : Manage State Globally


   d) useMemo()
   e) useReducer()
   f) useContext() :  share state between deeply nested components more easily than with useState alone.

   g) fetch()
   h) Callback()
