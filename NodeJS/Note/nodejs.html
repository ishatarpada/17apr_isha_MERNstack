What is Node JS :- Run time environment for javascript

Using Node JS
=> we can run Javascript outside of the browser
=> js can talk to native machine because of c++
=> we can create web servers in js

npm => Node Package Manager

version of Node Js :- Node --version
version of npm :- npm -v

how to create package.json => using npm init.

in node js remove all window functionality and add the server side , file handling functionality .

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Module :- Module is the chunk of code in external file that performs specific task or function.


Require function :- it does so with a singular argument -> the file path.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Async :- Asynchronously means that the program may not necessarily execute line by line.

Sync :- Synchronously means that the program is executed line by line.
The program waits until the called function or the operation returns.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Node js Architecture :-

client send request to server and server build in node js and all request in event queue and then go to event loop

Requests :-
Incoming requests can be blocking (complex) or non-blocking (simple), depending upon the tasks that a user wants to
perform in a web application.

Node.js Server
Node.js server is a server-side platform that takes requests from users, processes those requests, and returns responses
to the corresponding users.


Event Queue :- it is the type of queue it is store the user's request and based on fifo relation.

Event Loop => watch on the event queue and pick up the request in ths event queue and processed this request and return
the response to clients or users.

Blocking Operation :- It refers to the blocking of further operation until the current operation finishes.
Blocking methods are executed synchronously. Synchronously means that the program is executed line by line.
The program waits until the called function or the operation returns.

Thread Pool => Thread pool consists of all the threads available for carrying out some tasks that might be fulfill
client request.


Non-Blocking Operation :- it request is simple then event loop pick up the request and send the response to client.
It refers to the program that does not block the execution of further operations.
Non-Blocking methods are executed asynchronously. Asynchronously means that the program may not necessarily execute line
by line.
The program calls the function and move to the next operation and does not wait for it to return.

Default Thread Pool Size = 4

Max ? -> 8core cpu - 8

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

HTTP Server :- HTTP module can create an HTTP server that listens to server ports and gives a response back to the
client.

Building the Web Server :-

Step 1: Create the Server File
Create a file named index.js


Step 2: Import Required Modules
const http = require("http");


Step 3: Create the Server
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
console.log("New Request Receive");
console.log(req.headers);
console.log(req);
res.end("hello from server");
});


Step 4: Specify the Port and Start the Server
server.listen(8000, () => console.log("server started"));


Step 5: Run the Server
npm node index.js

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

URL :- Uniform Resource Locator

https://www.google.com/

https => HyperText Transfer Protocol secure
www.google.com => Domain - user friendly name of ip address of server
/ path => route path
Query Parameters =>

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

HTTP Methods :-
1. GET => get the data from the server.
2. POST => we want to send data and mutate(change/add data) some data in server.
3. PUT => upload the file or images on the server
4. PATCH => modified or change the existing data on server
5. DELETE => delete the data

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why Express JS :- easily handle routes, requests, and responses, which makes the process of creating robust and scalable
applications much easier.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

versioning :- 4.19.2 =>
1st part shows the major changes in package
2nd part shows the security and bug fixes changes in package
3rd part shows the minor changes in package

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rest API :- an application programming interface (API) that conforms to the design principles of the representational
state transfer (REST) architectural style.

API :-
=> API is a set of rules and protocols
=> Application Program Interface.
=> API is used for the when fronted library not directly communicate to database when this library send the request to
the API and API this request send to directly database and database send the response to API and API send this response
to fronted library.

Rules and Standard Protocols for Communication Between Client (Browser/Mobile/Alexa) and Server When Sending Requests or
Responses to a REST API

When a client (e.g., a web browser, mobile application, or voice assistant like Alexa) communicates with a server using
a REST API, the following rules and protocols are typically followed:


1. server client Architecture => both are not depended on server and client
2. always respect all http methods

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

MiddleWare :- a function that will have all the access for requesting an object, responding to an object, and moving to
the next middleware function in the application request-response cycle.

Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

Execute any code.
Make changes to the request and the response objects.
End the request-response cycle.
Call the next middleware function in the stack.

Express application can use the following types of middleware:

Application-level middleware
Router-level middleware
Error-handling middleware
Built-in middleware
Third-party middleware


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

HTTP Header : the client and the server pass additional information with an HTTP request or response

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

HTTP Status Code :-

Informational responses (100 - 199)
Successful responses (200 - 299)
Redirection messages (300 - 399)
Client error responses (400 - 499)
Server error responses (500 - 599)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

StateFull Authentication :-
=> server restart then all user is logged out

StateLess Authentication :-
=> server restart then all user is not logged out Because state is remove and state put in token(JWT)

JWT => Json Web Token
