         Array:- collection of  data type which store more than one value in single variable.
                
                for example :- const fruits = ["apple" , "mango" , "cherry" , "strawberry"];
                
                arrays are object . in array , different type of value is allowed in javascript array.
                in array we pass the function and object .

                in array we add item using index , push method and length property.

                Adding elements with high indexes can create undefined "holes" in an array.

                create the array using new Array or [] brackets.

                we access or changing the element using the index.

                if we convert array in string we use the toString() method.

                if we show the type of array we use the typeof method.

                if we sort the array we use sort() method.

                array is access using the loop or forEach function.

          Associative Arrays:-
          Many programming languages support arrays with named indexes.
          Arrays with named indexes are called associative arrays (or hashes).
          JavaScript does not support arrays with named indexes.
          In JavaScript, arrays always use numbered indexes.
