            variables can hold numbers like 100 and text values like "John Doe".

            Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes.
            If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string.

        Rules :- 
            variable can start with a-z , A-Z , underscore(_) , dollarSign($).

        =>  if variable has no value the variable is undefined.
