        JavaScript try and catch
            The try statement allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed.
            The catch statement allows you to define a block of code to be executed, if an error occurs in the try block.
            The JavaScript statements try and catch come in pairs:

            try {
                Block of code to try
            }
            catch(err) {
                Block of code to handle errors
            }
