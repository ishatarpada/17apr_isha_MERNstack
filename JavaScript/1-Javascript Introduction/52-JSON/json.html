                    JSON is storing and transporting data.

            JSON syntax rule:- 
                    => in JSON data are in names/values pair.
                    => in JSON { } curly braces are stored the data as object.

                employ: [
                            {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"},
                            {"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"},
                            {"firstName":"Peter", "lastName":"Jones"}
                        ]
            }"

            JSON object :- JSON objects are written inside curly braces.
                            it is the same as the javascript object.

            Converting a JSON Text to a JavaScript Object 
                => JSON text representing an object with properties .
                => than we used JSON.parse() method to convert this JSON text into a JavaScript object.
                => we can access the properties of the JavaScript object like any other JavaScript object.

            for example :- 

                let info = "{ employ:[
                                        {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"},
                                        {"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"},
                                        {"firstName":"Peter", "lastName":"Jones"}
                                    ]
                            }"

                let jsonObj = JSON.parse(info);
