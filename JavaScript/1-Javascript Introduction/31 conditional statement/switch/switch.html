       switch Statement :-  The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
                            The switch expression is evaluated once.
                            The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
                            If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
                            If there is no match, the default code block is executed.


        syntax :- switch(expression) {
                    case x:
                        // code block
                        break;
                    case y:
                        // code block
                        break;
                    default:
                        // code block
                    }

        The break Keyword
                When JavaScript reaches a break keyword, it breaks out of the switch block.
                This will stop the execution inside the switch block.
                It is not necessary to break the last case in a switch block. The block breaks (ends) there anyway.
