        Array Method :- 

        1. array.length => returns the length of the array.

        2. array.toString() => automatically  convert into the string.

        3. array.at() => returns the element given position.

        4. array.join(para) => join this parameter as separators.

        5. array.push("para") => add the element last index.
                              => para is the which item or value is adding.
                              
        6. array.pop() => remove the item or element from the last index.

        7. array.shift() => remove the item from the starting index.

        8. array.unshift() => add the item to the starting index.

        
        Changing the Element.
        1. using the index =>array[index]
        
        2.using array length. => array[array.length - n]

        3. delete() => delete the element.
                    => delete is return the undefined.
                    => delete the element but leaves the undefined value.
                    
        4. concat() => merge the array.
                    => concat() does not change the original array .
                    => it always return the new array.
                    => in concat() we take any no of argument.

        5. copyWithin() => copy array element another position.
                        => does not change in the length of array.
                        => copyWithin(para1 , para2 , para3)
                        =>  where para1 indicate the which position to copy element.
                        =>  para2 indicate copy to elements from which index.
                        =>  para3 indicates the copy the element to which index.
                        =>  copyWithin() change the original array.

        6. flat() => creates a new array with sub-array elements concatenated to a specified depth.
                 => flattening is used when we convert a multi-dimensional array into one-dimensional array.

        7. splice() => method add new element in array.
                    => method change the original array.
                    => The first parameter (2) defines the position where new elements should be added (spliced in).
                    => The second parameter (0) defines how many elements should be removed.
                    => The rest of the parameters define the new elements to be added.

        9. toSpliced() method don't change the original array.

        10. slice() =>  method is used to slice out the items of array into new array.
                    => slice(para1 , para2) => para1 indicates the which index to slice start. and para2 indicates the which index to slice end.
                    =>  slice method return the new array.
                    => slice method does not remove the any element from the original array.
