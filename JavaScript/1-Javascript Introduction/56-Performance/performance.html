        Performance :- 

        1. Reduce Activity in Loops
            =>Loops are often used in programming.
            => Each statement in a loop, including the for statement, is executed for each iteration of the loop.
            => Statements or assignments that can be placed outside the loop will make the loop run faster.

            => Bad:
                for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {}
            => Better Code:
                let l = arr.length;
                for (let i = 0; i < l; i++) {}

            => The bad code accesses the length property of an array each time the loop is iterated.
            => The better code accesses the length property outside the loop and makes the loop run faster.

        2. Reduce DOM Access
            => Accessing the HTML DOM is very slow, compared to other JavaScript statements.
            => If you expect to access a DOM element several times, access it once, and use it as a local variable

        3. Avoid Unnecessary Variables  

        4. Delay JavaScript Loading
            => Putting your scripts at the bottom of the page body lets the browser load the page first.
            => While a script is downloading, the browser will not start any other downloads. In addition all parsing and rendering activity might be blocked.
