        => Explicit Function Binding :- 
            The call() and apply() methods are predefined JavaScript methods.
            They can both be used to call an object method with another object as argument.

        => bind()
            bind() is used to create a new function that, when called, has its this keyword set to a specific value.

        => apply()
            apply() is used to call a function with a given this value and an array of arguments.

        => call()
            call() is similar to apply(), but it accepts an argument list, rather than an array of arguments.
        
        => object Function (Method)
            A method is a function that is a property of an object. When a method is called, the this keyword refers to the object that the method was called on.

        => Function in Global Scope
            A function in the global scope is simply a function defined outside of any other function or object.
