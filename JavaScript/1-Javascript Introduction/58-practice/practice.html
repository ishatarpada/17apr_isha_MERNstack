    <!-- 
        => avoid global variables , avoid new , avoid == , avoid eval() .

        => avoid global variable because global variable can be overwritten by other script.

        => always declare local variable .

        => Local variables must be declared with the var, the let, or the const keyword, otherwise they will become global variables.

        => Declarations on Top
            => Give cleaner code
            => Provide a single place to look for local variables
            => Make it easier to avoid unwanted (implied) global variables
            => Reduce the possibility of unwanted re-declarations

        => Initialize Variables

        => declare object with const

        => declare array with const

        => Don't Use new Object()
            => Use "" instead of new String()
            => Use 0 instead of new Number()
            => Use false instead of new Boolean()
            => Use {} instead of new Object()
            => Use [] instead of new Array()
            => Use /()/ instead of new RegExp()
            => Use function (){} instead of new Function()

        =>Beware of Automatic Type Conversions
            => JavaScript is loosely typed.
            => A variable can contain all data types.
            => A variable can change its data type

        => Use === Comparison
            => The == comparison operator always converts (to matching types) before comparison.
            => The === operator forces comparison of values and type.

        => Use Parameter Defaults
            => If a function is called with a missing argument, the value of the missing argument is set to undefined.
            => Undefined values can break your code. It is a good habit to assign default values to arguments.

        => End Your Switches with Defaults

        => Avoid Number, String, and Boolean as Objects because this is slow the code and execution speed.

        => Avoid eval() 
            => The eval() function is used to run text as code. In almost all cases, it should not be necessary to use it.
            => Because it allows arbitrary code to be run, it also represents a security problem.
