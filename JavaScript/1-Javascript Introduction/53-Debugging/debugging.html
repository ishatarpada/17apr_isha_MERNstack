    <!-- Debugging :- 
                        => The debugger keyword stops the execution of JavaScript, and calls (if available) the debugging function.
                        => This has the same function as setting a breakpoint in the debugger.
                        => If no debugging is available, the debugger statement has no effect.
                        => With the debugger turned on, this code will stop executing before it executes the third line.
