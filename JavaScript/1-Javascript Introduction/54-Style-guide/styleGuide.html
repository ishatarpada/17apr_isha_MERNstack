            Style Guide :-  1. variable name declare in camel case like firstName.

                            2. Spaces Around Operators.

                            3. always use 2 spaces for indentation of block of code.and don't use tabs for indentation.

                            4. Statement Rules
                                => Always end a simple statement with a semicolon.
                                => Put the opening bracket at the end of the first line.
                                => Use one space before the opening bracket.
                                => Put the closing bracket on a new line, without leading spaces.
                                => Do not end a complex statement with a semicolon.

                            5. Object rules
                                => Place the opening bracket on the same line as the object name.
                                => Use colon plus one space between each property and its value.
                                => Use quotes around string values, not around numeric values.
                                => Do not add a comma after the last property-value pair.
                                => Place the closing bracket on a new line, without leading spaces.
                                => Always end an object definition with a semicolon.

                            6. Line Length < 80

                            7. Naming Conventions : 
                                => variable and function name written in camelCase.
                                => global variable and constant written in uppercase.
                                => hyphens used in HTML and CSS . don't use in javascript.
                                => underscore are often used in php documentation.
                                => PascalCase is often used in c programmers.
                                => camelCase is used by JavaScript itself, by jQuery, and other JavaScript libraries.

                            8. Loading JavaScript in HTML
                                <script src = "javascript file name"></script>

                            9. Accessing HTML elements.
                                A consequence of using "untidy" HTML styles, might result in JavaScript errors.
                                These two JavaScript statements will produce different results:
                                const obj = getElementById("Demo")
                                const obj = getElementById("demo")
                                If possible, use the same naming convention (as JavaScript) in HTML.

                            10. File Extensions:-
                                html file saved as .html
                                css file saved as .css
                                javascript file saved as .js

                            11. Use Lower Case File Names
