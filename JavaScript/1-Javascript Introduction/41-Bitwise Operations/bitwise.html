        JavaScript Bitwise Operators
        Operator	Name	                Description
        &	        AND	                    Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1
        |	        OR	                    Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1
        ^	        XOR	                    Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1
        ~	        NOT	                    Inverts all the bits
        <<	        Zero fill left shift	Shifts left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off
        >>	        Signed right shift	    Shifts right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off
        >>>	        Zero fill right shift	Shifts right by pushing zeros in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off
