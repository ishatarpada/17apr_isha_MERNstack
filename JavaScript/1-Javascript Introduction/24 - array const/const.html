        Array const :- declare arrays 

        => can not be reassigned when we use const keyword.

        => when we use const keyword it does not mean array is constant but we still changed the element.

        => when we declare the array we must be assigned the value.

        =>An array declared with const has Block Scope.

        => An array declared in a block is not the same as an array declared outside the block.

        => when we declare the array using const keyword we don't redeclare the array.
