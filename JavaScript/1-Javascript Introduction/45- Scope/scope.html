        Scope :- There are 3 types of scope.
                 1. block scope
                 2. global scope
                 3. function scope
                 4. local scope

        1. Block Scope :-   variable declare in {} block of code.
                            let and const are block scope variables.
                            in block scope variable can't access outside the block of code.

        2. Global Scope :-  Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope.
                            Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program.
                            Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block.

        3. Function Scope :- JavaScript has function scope: Each function creates a new scope.
                            Variables defined inside a function are not accessible (visible) from outside the function.
                            Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared inside a function.

        4. Local Scope :-   Local variables have Function Scope.
                            They can only be accessed from within the function.
                            Local variables are created when a function starts, and deleted when the function is completed.
                            Local variables are only recognized inside their functions, variables with the same name can be used in different functions.

        => Automatically Global Scope 
                 If you assign a value to a variable that has not been declared, it will automatically become a GLOBAL variable.
                 This code example will declare a global variable carName, even if the value is assigned inside a function.

        Global variables defined with the let keyword do not belong to the window object.
        Global variables defined with the var keyword belong to the window object.
