        Object Property :-  
        => Properties are the most important part of any JavaScript object.
        => Properties are the values associated with a JavaScript object.

            objectName.property      // person.age
            objectName["property"]   // person["age"]

        Adding New Properties : objName.propertyName = value

        Delete the Properties :
            => The delete keyword deletes both the value of the property and the property itself.
            => After deletion, the property cannot be used before it is added back again.
            => The delete operator is designed to be used on object properties. It has no effect on variables or functions.
