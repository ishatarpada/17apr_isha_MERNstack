        <h1>Psuedo class :- Active </h1>
        <p>&#x21e5;The :active selector is used to select and style the active link.
            <br>                                                                            
            &#x21e5;A link becomes active when you click on it.
            <br>    
            &#x21e5;Tip: The :active selector can be used on all elements, not only links.
            <br>    
            &#x21e5;Tip: Use the :link selector to style links to unvisited pages, the :visited selector to style links to visited pages, and the :hover selector to style links when you mouse over them.
            <br>    
            &#x21e5;Note: :active MUST come after :hover (if present) in the CSS definition in order to be effective!
