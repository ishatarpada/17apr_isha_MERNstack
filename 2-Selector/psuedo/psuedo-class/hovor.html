            &#x21e5; The :hover selector is used to select elements when you mouse over them.
            <br>
            &#x21e5; Tip: The :hover selector can be used on all elements, not only on links.
            <br>
            &#x21e5; Tip: Use the :link selector to style links to unvisited pages, the :visited selector to style links to
            visited pages, and the :active selector to style the active link.
            <br>
            &#x21e5; Note: :hover MUST come after :link and :visited (if they are present) in the CSS definition, in order to be
            effective!
